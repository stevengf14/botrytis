  "sec.1.title": "The Disease",
  "sec.1.full": "The Threat: Botrytis Cinerea",
  "sec.1.content": "Botrytis cinerea (also known as gray mold) is not just an aesthetic issue; it is a \"first-order phytosanitary threat\" that affects the quality and productivity of roses, causing symptoms such as petal wilting and tissue rot. In the floriculture sector, this pathogen is responsible for massive economic losses due to its rapid spread in humid and cold environments. Our project stems from the need for early detection, as traditional methods focus on human visual inspection, which is prone to errors, subjective, and often occurs when the infection is irreversible. Therefore, early detection is crucial to intercept the infection in its initial stages and prevent its spread. In this way, the present project arises to automate this process, providing a constant surveillance tool that protects the producers' investment.",
  "sec.2.title": "Proposed Solution",
  "sec.2.full": "Computer Vision and Deep Learning (CNN)",
  "sec.2.content": "The solution is primarily based on the field of Computer Vision, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a standard Deep Learning architecture for deep learning that was specifically designed to emulate the human visual system in identifying complex patterns. Through convolutional layers, the model extracts automatic features such as edges, textures, and chromatic anomalies characteristic of Botrytis aqueous micro-spots. This technology allows for the processing of high-resolution images, offering a diagnostic capability that surpasses human fatigue and guarantees an objective and standardized classification in the field.",  
  "sec.3.title": "Scientific Rigor",
  "sec.3.full": "Data Acquisition, Preprocessing, and Augmentation",
  "sec.3.content": "The effectiveness of the model lies in the scientific rigor applied during the data phase. A diverse dataset was structured, capturing roses in different health states and under various lighting conditions. To strengthen the model, Data Augmentation techniques were applied, such as rotations, contrast adjustments, and zoom, forcing the AI to learn intrinsic characteristics of the fungus rather than memorizing specific images. This preprocessing ensures that the neural network is robust against real variations in the agricultural environment, minimizing false negatives and optimizing detection precision.",  
  "sec.4.title": "Benefits",
  "sec.4.full": "Prototype, Fungicide Reduction, and Field Benefits",
  "sec.4.content": "The project culminates in the creation of a functional prototype capable of performing detections by uploading images of roses from the flower farm, facilitating immediate decision-making on the plantation. The benefits are tangible: early detection allows for the application of biological or chemical treatments only in the affected areas, resulting in a drastic reduction in the use of fungicides and input costs. Furthermore, by decreasing the chemical load, the environmental sustainability of the crop is improved, ensuring that the flowers meet the quality standards required by international export markets.",
